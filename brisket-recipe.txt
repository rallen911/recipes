I use 10-16 lb briskets.  Best price that I have found is Walmart.
I trim the fat cap to about ¼ inch.
I let it sit overnight in the fridge with a rub of salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and mustard.
I use a mix of hickory and apple (or cherry) wood.
I cook it to 185°F-190°F.  It takes between 12 and 16 hours.
I baste it with apple juice at the 8, 12, and 14 hour points.
